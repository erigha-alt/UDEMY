# UDEMY ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION

Description:
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information about Udemy courses. 
The goal was to gain insights into various aspects of the courses and build a classification model to predict whether a course is paid or free. 
The dataset included details such as course titles, subject, level, number of subscribers, number of lectures, content duration, and more.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Udemy Courses Analysis Project!
This project involves the exploration and classification of a dataset containing information about Udemy courses.
The primary objective is to gain insights into various course attributes and create a classification model to predict whether a course is paid or free.

# Installation
o run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


## Usage

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset using the provided path and explore its contents using various analysis techniques.

Data Visualization: Visualize data distributions, trends, and relationships among different features using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

Feature Engineering: Transform and engineer features as needed, such as creating bins for 'Subscribers' and eliminating outliers.

Model Building: Implement a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify courses as paid or free based on relevant features.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Contributions to Analysis: The project aims to provide insights into Udemy course data, making it a valuable resource for course creators and administrators.
Contributions can be made by enhancing data analysis, improving visualization, or refining the classification model.
